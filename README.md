This section explores backtracking, an algorithmic technique for solving problems incrementally by exploring all possible configurations and abandoning paths that lead to dead ends.

Definition and Approach: Explained backtracking as a method for solving constraint satisfaction problems by building candidates and abandoning those that fail to satisfy the constraints.

Key Concepts: Discussed the importance of recursion and the use of state space trees to visualize potential solutions and backtrack when a path is not viable.

Common Problems: Illustrated classic backtracking problems, such as the N-Queens problem, Sudoku solving, and the Hamiltonian path problem, providing examples of each.

Performance Considerations: Analyzed the efficiency of backtracking algorithms, noting that while they can be computationally intensive, they are often more efficient than brute-force approaches.

Practical Applications: Highlighted real-world applications, including puzzle solving, game development, and optimization problems in artificial intelligence.
